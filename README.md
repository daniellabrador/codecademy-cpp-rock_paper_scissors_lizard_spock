# **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**

The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock program is a modified version of the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game but provides [seven more outcomes](https://youtu.be/zjoVuV8EeOU?t=50). This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

## Project Prompt

You may have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you played [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSHPVCBsnLw)? This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show *The Big Bang Theory*.

Write a `RPSLS.cpp` program that:

- Prompts the user to select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
- Instructs the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
- Compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice and determine the winner.
- Informs the user who the winner is.

### Background

As aptly put by [Sheldon Cooper of The Big Bang Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSHPVCBsnLw):

> “I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.”

### Logic

- Scissors cuts Paper.
- Paper covers Rock.
- Rock crushes Lizard.
- Lizard poisons Spock.
- Spock smashes Scissors.
- Scissors decapitate Lizard.
- Lizard eats Paper.
- Paper disproves Spock.
- Spock vaporizes Rock.
- Rock crushes Scissors.

**Note:** This project will be particularly challenging due to its complex logic. Beware! Only the brave should venture forth.

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `RPSLS.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ RPSLS.cpp -o RPSLS
./RPSLS
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ RPSLS.cpp -o RPSLS
RPSLS.exe
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.

As cited in Codecademy's [project prompt](#project-prompt), the game is inspired from the game invented in the TV show, The Big Bang Theory.
